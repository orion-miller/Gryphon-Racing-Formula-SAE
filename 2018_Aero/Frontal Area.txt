Made sketch of outside silhouette of car in the front plane
Section area = 0.67 m^2
Made sketch of gaps on either side of roll hoop
Section areas = 0.05 m^2 (for both)
Measured tire cross sections
Section area = 0.19 m^2 (for both)
Found tire offset area = 0.04 m^2

So total frontal area is
0.67 + 0.19 + 0.04 - 0.05
=0.85 m^2
