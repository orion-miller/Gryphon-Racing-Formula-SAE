function [friction_instant] = TireFunction(weight_on_tire,tire_choice)

%Tire Selection.  The equations that follow are based on tabulated Excel
%data.  The data was compiled based on a slip angle varrying between -5
%degrees and 13 degrees, an average between the values was taken at various
%normal loads.  With the average and corresponding normal load, a graph was
%created and the equation extrapolated to be used in the following MatLab
%code.

%Correction factor is 0.67 which is multiplied by the instantaneous
%coefficient of friction to obtain a real world coefficient of friction.
%Used 0.55 instead of 0.67 to get more realistic acceleration results as
%0.67 yielded longitudinal acceleration of .8g's and 0.55 comes closer to
%0.5g's.

%Tire 1=Goodyear 13"
%Tire 2=Hoosier 13"
%Tire 3=Hoosier Small 13"
%Tire 4=Michelin 13"
